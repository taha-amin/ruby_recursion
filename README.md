# Assignment: Fibonacci
1. Write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence. Use iteration for this solution.
2. Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines.

# Assignment: Merge Sort
1. Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
2. Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can be actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!)
